  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gatsby - Contentful
</h1>

Demo started from the hello-world boilerplate: this starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_You also may want to check out the vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Open the `gatsby-contentful` project directory**

2. **Add the environment config files _.env.development_ with this defined variables:**
    ```sh
        CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=aa6lmvvj10ja
        CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=coEg-s-TeNE4MIZnenmUau8zdPNpZZQc5LqeJ9dW6qU
        GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground
    ```
    
3. **Add the environment config files _.env.production_ with this defined variables:**
    ```sh
        CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=aa6lmvvj10ja
        CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=coEg-s-TeNE4MIZnenmUau8zdPNpZZQc5LqeJ9dW6qU
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
        npm i
    ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
        npm start
    ```

- You can now view the demo. Open up a new tab in your browser and navigate to:

  http://localhost:8000/
⠀
- View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema:

  http://localhost:8000/___graphql

- Your Gatsby GraphQL Playground is running on:

  http://localhost:8000/___playground

_Note that the development build is not optimized._
_To create a production build, use `npm run build`_





## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.





## 📦 What was added?

1.  **[gatsby-plugin-playground](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-playground/)**: A gatsby plugin to use Prisma Playground

    Adds the Prisma playground to your gatsby dev server. This is running in parallel to GraphiQl. What you will get is the Playground on the route `/___playground`, which you can use to query your data and test them out.

2.  **[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/)**: Gatsby plugin which parses files within a directory for further parsing by other plugins ()

    A Gatsby source plugin for sourcing data into your Gatsby application from your local filesystem.
The plugin creates File nodes from files. The various “transformer” plugins can transform File nodes into various other types of data e.g. gatsby-transformer-json transforms JSON files into JSON data nodes and gatsby-transformer-remark transforms markdown files into MarkdownRemark nodes from which you can query an HTML representation of the markdown.

3.  **[gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/)**: Lazy-loading React image component with optional support for the blur-up effect

    Speedy, optimized images without the work.
gatsby-image is a React component specially designed to work seamlessly with Gatsby’s GraphQL queries. It combines Gatsby’s native image processing capabilities with advanced image loading techniques to easily and completely optimize image loading for your sites. gatsby-image uses gatsby-plugin-sharp to power its image transformations.

4.  **[gatsby-background-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-background-image/)**: Lazy-loading React background-image component with optional support for the blur-up effect

    It has all the advantages of gatsby-image, including the “blur-up” technique or a ”traced placeholder” SVG to show a preview of the image while it loads,
plus being usable as a container (no more hacks with extra wrappers),
plus being able to work with multiple stacked background images.

5. **[gatsby-plugin-sass](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/)**: Gatsby plugin to handle scss/sass files

6. **[gatsby-plugin-react-css-modules](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-background-image/)**: Gatsby plugin that transforms styleName to className using compile time CSS module resolution

7. **[gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/)**: Gatsby plugin to add support for styled components

8. **[gatsby-plugin-transition-link](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-transition-link/)**: A link component for page transitions in gatsby ([Gatsby Plugin Transition Link documentation](https://transitionlink.tylerbarnes.ca/))

9. **[gatsby-source-contentful](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-contentful/)**: Gatsby source plugin for building websites using the [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/) as a data source

10. **[gatsby-plugin-react-helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/)**: Manage document head data with react-helmet. Provides drop-in server rendering support for Gatsby.

11. **[gatsby-plugin-sitemap](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sitemap/)**: Gatsby plugin that automatically creates a sitemap for your site
